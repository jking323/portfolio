I design hardware for industrial computers, build tube amplifiers and DAPs in my workshop,
and run a cigar shop in central Florida. I'm currently recreating the Intel 4004
microprocessor from original documentation and learning Italian for my move to Rome.
I believe in owning your tools, your data, and your infrastructure.
