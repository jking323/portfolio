This is a placeholder for your first post. Write it in markdown, push to your repo, and it deploys automatically.

Some things that might go here:

- The moment you realized Google was the product, not the customer
- What it took to migrate email, photos, music, documents
- What you gained and what you gave up
- The $200/month in streaming services that now costs $9/month in Backblaze

Write it when it's ready. The page will be here.
