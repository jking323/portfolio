Some things that might go here:

- The moment you realized Google was the product, not the customer
- What it took to migrate email, photos, music, documents
- What you gained and what you gave up
- The $200/month in streaming services that now costs $9/month in Backblaze

Welcome to my first post! I don't know what I'm doing so expect typos and weird formatting until I relearn markdown outside of simple things.

So why I left the cloud. Honestly it was a process that started years ago when I wanted to stop throwing hundreds a month away on services that didn't care about me. I started seeing all my favorite shows leave netflix, music services dropping the ball, and the big one the fact that particularly with music the artist gets next to nothing per stream. I started looking around and decided I want to own my stuff again, I lost trust in disney when they cropped the simpsons, I lost trust in Spotify when they started flooding their servie with ai, I quickly went from "AI is cool" to "My rice cooker doesn't need AI" and so I started looking.

## Music
This is a big one for me, I love music, I am an audiophile(look at my projects, three of them are audio!) So I decided I wanted to hear the music how the artist intended, streaming doesn't hold up though they are "trying" but the biggest issue is artist support. A lot of my favorite bands are small, some unsigned and so they rely on income from their art to eat! Realizing that each of my streams amounts to less than a penny the artist, sometimes as low as $0.0003 per stream, what is that?! I didn't know you could cut a penny that low, so I did the math, I'd have to stream all our gods have abandoned us by architects 30,000 times all the way through in order to amount to one album purchase, and that isn't accounting for label splits! Some bands it'd be 50 to 100,000 streams for the artist to see the 16 dollars a cd costs. That is unacceptible, I decided to change that. And yes I use Lidarr and usenet, you could argue the streaming they get something but usenet they don't get anything. Well every album in my library I buy the flacs if possible or donate the value of the album as I go. Lidarr with the rest of the stack is my discovery path since I don't have algorithms anymore. So I am trying to do all I can, sometimes albums simply aren't available or the cd happens to be rare and people on ebay want hundreds of dollars. I am working on an "ethical \*arr" that allows the user to find the bandcamp or artists store to buy the album! That will be tackled when I find some more time.

## Movies & TV
This is where I realized I was dumping hundreds a month into services I barely use. So I decided to just buy the dvds and blu rays, rip them and have the full bitrate version. I hate getting gimped by streaming a 4k movie and never seeing the movie how it was intended, horrible compression artifacts got tiring so I took matters into my own hands!

## Philosophy
I hate being the product, I have nothing to hide but I don't need a trillion dollar company knowing everything I know and think, I don't like being manipulated by an algorithm to confirm my bias, I want to see both sides, I want to not be controlled. So I started purging every service that I could think of, I left gmail(that was the most difficult transition) I left apple, I left the cheap cloud storage platforms and decided my data was mine.
