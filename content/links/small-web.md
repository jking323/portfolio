Sites and projects that remind me what the internet was supposed to be.

- [250kb.club](https://250kb.club/) — sites under 250KB
- [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) — the generous version
- [1MB.club](https://1mb.club/) — still smaller than most homepages
- [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/) — search engine for the small web
- [Wiby](https://wiby.me/) — search for old-school sites
- [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) — own your content
- [Yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org/) — reclaiming the web
