An open-source baseboard management controller on a PCIe card. Plug it into any standard PC and get out-of-band management: KVM over IP, power control, virtual media. An open alternative to Dell iDRAC and HP iLO.

Built on the Beacon i.MX8M Mini SOM with a Lattice CrossLink-NX FPGA for video capture and a Silicon Motion SM768 for display emulation. Every interface is an industry standard — LVDS, MIPI CSI-2, I2C, USB, PCIe, Ethernet. Any block is replaceable without a board respin.

More details as the prototype develops.
