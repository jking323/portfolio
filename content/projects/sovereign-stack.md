A fully self-hosted infrastructure running on a home server in Florida, accessible from anywhere via Tailscale. Every service behind Traefik with a private CA, filtered through Pi-hole, backed up to Backblaze.

I stood most of this up from a hotel in Italy over two days. The server doesn't know I'm 5,000 miles away, and that's the point.

## The Stack

**Network:** Traefik reverse proxy, Pi-hole DNS, Tailscale mesh VPN, pfSense router

**Documents:** Paperless-ngx, BookStack wiki, Wallabag read-later, Linkwarden bookmarks

**Media:** Plex + Plexamp, Lidarr, Prowlarr, SABnzbd, qBittorrent

**Photos:** Immich

**Code:** Gitea, with mirrors to GitHub

**Tools:** Stirling-PDF, CyberChef, IT-Tools, Part-DB, Uptime Kuma

**Business:** Custom cigar shop backoffice with Square API integration

## Philosophy

If a service requires an internet connection to function and stores my data on someone else's server, I replace it. The goal is infrastructure that works for me rather than extracting from me.
