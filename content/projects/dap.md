This is my most ambitious project, building a high quality DAP with the cleanest analog chain i can get! AKM provides their flagship dac shipset and it will be set in dual mono. I'm using an STM32H7 for the brain and it'll run on three 18650 cells. My current power target won't be the stinkiest out put, 500mW on the balanced out, but the goal is the cleanest possible signal chain.

I call it the Dingus! Big ups to dankpods for inspiring me to go down this path and encouraging the anti snobbery side of audio!
