# Vinyl Pressing Guide: What to Buy and Why

*A practical guide to original pressings, key reissues, and what actually matters — stripped of audiophile mythology.*

---

## A Note on How to Use This Guide

This guide focuses on the pressings that matter and why, organized chronologically by genre. For each album the target pressing is listed first, followed by what to look for and realistic price ranges. Prices reflect Discogs market conditions as of 2025 and will vary with condition.

**Condition grading matters more than anything else.** A VG+ original pressing will outperform a NM reissue in most cases. Minimum acceptable grade for serious listening is VG+. NM is ideal. Anything below VG+ on a record you intend to actually play is a risk.

**The dead wax is your friend.** The matrix numbers etched in the runout groove between the last track and the label tell you more about a pressing than the label itself. Learn to read them for each label and era.

**Discogs is the primary market.** Use catalog numbers to find the master release, then filter by country and year to find the specific pressing. Each pressing variant has its own release ID in the URL.

## Pre-War Blues

### Robert Johnson — King of the Delta Blues Singers
**Target:** Classic Records 200g reissue
**Catalog:** Columbia CL 1654 original (1961)
**Label:** Columbia

The complete Johnson recordings — 29 songs from two sessions in 1936 and 1937 — represent the foundation of the blues tradition that runs through every artist in this guide. Original Vocalion 78rpm shellac pressings from 1936-37 exist but are specialist collector items running $500-5000+ per disc requiring period playback equipment. For practical purposes the Classic Records 200g reissue of the 1961 Columbia LP is the recommended vinyl option.

**What to look for:** The 1990 Complete Recordings on Columbia (C2K 46222) sourced by Steven LaVere from the best surviving 78s is considered the reference transfer. On vinyl, original 1961 Columbia six-eye pressings (CL 1654) exist and are historically interesting. The Classic Records 200g reissue is the practical choice.

**Price range:** Original 1961 Columbia: $100-300 depending on condition. Classic Records reissue: $50-100.

---

## Electric Blues — Chess Records Era

### Muddy Waters — The Best of Muddy Waters
**Target:** Original Chess pressing
**Catalog:** Chess LP 1427 (1958)
**Label:** Chess (silver and blue label)

The album that defined electric blues for the rock generation. Original first pressing identifiable by the silver and blue Chess label without the checkerboard border that appeared on later pressings.

**Price range:** $80-200 for good copies.

---

### Muddy Waters — Folk Singer
**Target:** Original Chess pressing
**Catalog:** Chess 1483 (1964)
**Label:** Chess (blue and silver label)

An acoustic album recorded with extraordinary care — considered one of the best-sounding blues records ever made. The recording captures Waters' voice and guitar with an intimacy that later pressings and transfers don't replicate. Consistently underpriced relative to its quality.

**What to look for:** Blue and silver Chess label. Early matrix suffixes in the runout. Complete with original inner sleeve if possible.

**Price range:** $50-150 for good copies — exceptional value.

---

## Jazz — The Blue Note Era

### A note on Blue Note pressings generally

Blue Note Records produced some of the finest jazz recordings ever made at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in Hackensack and later Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Van Gelder's engineering signature — close-miked instruments, present drums, a specific piano sound with the lid partially closed — is immediately identifiable and part of the music itself.

**Key identifiers for original Blue Note pressings:**

- **Label address:** Earliest pressings say "Blue Note Records Inc. 767 Lexington Ave NY." Later pressings say "47 West 63rd Street." Liberty-era pressings (post-1966) are less desirable but still good.
- **Deep groove:** A concentric pressed ring around the label area visible at an angle. Generally indicates earlier pressing from fresher stampers.
- **RVG stamp:** "RVG" hand-etched in the dead wax by Van Gelder himself. Original pressings have hand-etched (slightly uneven) RVG. Later reissues have a mechanically stamped version that looks more uniform.

---

### John Coltrane — Blue Train
**Target:** Original Blue Note pressing
**Catalog:** Blue Note BLP 1577 (1957)
**Label:** Blue Note (47 W 63rd address, deep groove preferred)

Coltrane's only album as a leader for Blue Note and one of the great jazz recordings. The title track's opening trumpet figure and Coltrane's saxophone entry are a genuine test of a system's ability to render brass instruments accurately.

**What to look for:** 47 West 63rd label, deep groove, RVG hand-etched in dead wax. Early matrix suffixes.

**Price range:** $300-800 for a good copy. Worth every cent.

---

### Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers — Moanin'
**Target:** Original Blue Note pressing
**Catalog:** Blue Note BLP 4003 (1958)
**Label:** Blue Note (47 W 63rd address)

The gateway drug for Blue Note collecting. Hard bop at its most visceral. The title track's piano introduction is one of the most recognizable figures in jazz.

**What to look for:** 47 West 63rd label, deep groove, RVG hand-etched. Early matrix suffixes (low alphanumeric).

**Price range:** $200-600 for good copies.

---

### Horace Silver — Song for My Father
**Target:** Original Blue Note pressing
**Catalog:** Blue Note BLP 4185 (1964)
**Label:** Blue Note

One of the most sampled records in jazz and hip hop history. The bass line on the title track has appeared in more songs than can be counted. Original pressing captures the warm, immediate Van Gelder sound at its peak.

**Price range:** $100-300 for good copies.

---

### Herbie Hancock — Maiden Voyage
**Target:** Original Blue Note pressing
**Catalog:** Blue Note BLP 4195 (1965)
**Label:** Blue Note

More modal and spacious than the hard bop records but Van Gelder's recording is extraordinary — the piano sound in particular is a benchmark. The ocean-themed compositions reward careful listening on a good system.

**Price range:** $100-250 for good copies.

---

### Lee Morgan — The Sidewinder
**Target:** Original Blue Note pressing
**Catalog:** Blue Note BLP 4157 (1963)
**Label:** Blue Note

Hard bop at its most infectious. The title track's bass line drove Blue Note's commercial crossover into mainstream popularity. Original pressing essential for the full Van Gelder experience.

**Price range:** $150-400 for good copies.

---

## Jazz — Columbia and Miles Davis

### Miles Davis — Kind of Blue
**Target:** Original Columbia six-eye pressing OR 2010 Legacy 180g reissue
**Catalog:** Columbia CL 1355 mono / CS 8163 stereo (1959)
**Label:** Columbia (six-eye label, pre-CBS)
**Barcode for 2010 Legacy reissue:** 88697680571

The best-selling jazz album of all time and one of the most documented pressing histories in music. The original six-eye Columbia pressing — identifiable by the six small circular logos around the Columbia label — was pressed between 1959 and approximately 1963 across multiple plants.

**Key facts:**
- The first three tracks (So What, Freddie Freeloader, Blue in Green) were recorded with a tape machine running slightly slow, making them a barely perceptible quarter-tone sharp. This was corrected in the 1995 Classic Records reissue.
- The mono pressing commands a significant premium over stereo. The mono mix is the primary artistic statement.
- Very earliest pressings identifiable by the side two label listing tracks in incorrect order (Flamenco Sketches before All Blues). This label error was corrected after the first few months of production but the back cover misprint persisted for decades.
- The 2010 Legacy reissue (88697680571) is a digital-master-to-lacquer cut pressed at RTI — good but not the same chain as cutting directly from the original analog tapes.
- The Analogue Productions UHQR pressed from Bernie Grundman's 1995 direct-from-tape cut is considered the finest modern pressing.

**What to look for on originals:** Six-eye label without CBS text. Early matrix suffixes (1A, 1B, 1D rather than 1AK or later). Deep groove on mono copies. Early stereo copies: XSM prefix matrix numbers.

**Price range:** Original six-eye stereo: $150-400 good condition. Original six-eye mono: $300-800. 2010 Legacy reissue: $30-60. UHQR: $150 new.

---

## Jazz — Impulse Records

### John Coltrane — A Love Supreme
**Target:** Original Impulse pressing
**Catalog:** Impulse A-77 (1964)
**Label:** Impulse (orange and black label)

The peak of Coltrane's spiritual jazz period and one of the great recorded performances in any genre. The original orange and black Impulse label pressing is the target. The Van Gelder stamp in the dead wax indicates authentic lacquer cut.

**Key facts:**
- Impulse recorded on 35mm magnetic film as well as standard tape in some sessions, giving the label's recordings an unusual sonic character.
- MCA/ABC reissues from the 1970s and 1980s are considered inferior. Acoustic Sounds/Analogue Productions reissue is the best modern option.
- The four-part suite structure rewards uninterrupted listening — side one and side two each contain two movements.

**What to look for:** Orange and black label without MCA text. RVG hand-etched in dead wax. Early matrix suffixes.

**Price range:** Original orange-black label: $150-500 depending on condition. Analogue Productions reissue: $50 new.

---

### John Coltrane — Live at the Village Vanguard
**Target:** Original Impulse pressing
**Catalog:** Impulse A-10 (1962)
**Label:** Impulse (orange and black label)

The classic quartet in a legendary live setting. The intimacy of the Village Vanguard room is captured with unusual fidelity for a live jazz recording of this era.

**Price range:** $100-300 for good original copies.

---

## Classic Rock — UK Originals

### A note on UK versus US pressings

For British rock recorded in the late 1960s through the 1970s, UK pressings are generally preferred for several reasons: lower cutting levels preserve more dynamic range, the mastering facilities (Olympic, Island, Abbey Road) were closer to the source recordings, and engineers like George Peckham (who signed his cuts "Porky" in the dead wax) had relationships with the artists that informed their cutting decisions. US pressings were typically cut hotter for radio and jukebox competition.

**George Peckham dead wax inscriptions:** "Porky" on side one and "Pecko Duck" on side two are considered quality indicators on UK pressings from the early 1970s onward.

---

## Led Zeppelin

### Led Zeppelin I
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic 588171 (UK, 1969)
**Label:** Atlantic (turquoise/silver label earliest, then plum/orange)

Recorded in 36 hours at Olympic Studios, London. Glyn Johns' original mix is on the UK pressing — Page remixed without Johns' knowledge for the US release, making these genuinely different recordings at a fundamental level.

**What to look for:** Turquoise and silver Atlantic label (earliest) or plum and orange (still original era). "Porky" inscription in dead wax. Early matrix suffix letters. The matrix format is typically 588171 A//1 and 588171 B//1 on earliest copies.

**Price range:** £100-400 depending on label variant and condition.

---

### Led Zeppelin II
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic 588198 (UK, 1969)
**Label:** Atlantic (plum and orange)

The stereo field on this record was designed as a physical experience — the mid-section of Whole Lotta Love uses panning effects that on a compressed US pressing lose much of their spatial character. The original UK pressing with a good stylus is genuinely startling.

**What to look for:** Plum and orange Atlantic label. "Porky"/"Pecko Duck" dead wax inscriptions. Early matrix suffix letters.

**Price range:** £100-350 for good copies.

---

### Led Zeppelin III
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic 2401 002 (UK, 1970)
**Label:** Atlantic

**Important note:** Original pressing came with a rotating volvelle (cardboard pinwheel) on the cover revealing images through holes in the outer sleeve. Complete copies with the intact volvelle are worth considerably more. Always ask about this specifically when buying.

**Price range:** £80-250. Add premium for intact volvelle.

---

### Led Zeppelin IV
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic 2401 012 (UK, 1971)
**Label:** Atlantic (no title, no band name on cover)

The most played Zeppelin album and therefore the hardest to find in genuine unplayed condition. When the Levee Breaks was recorded with drums in the stairwell of Headley Grange — the ambient space is part of the recording and is captured more fully on the original pressing than any reissue.

**Critical condition warning:** Check specifically for play wear on Stairway to Heaven in the quiet opening section. Groove damage from repeated plays on budget turntables is permanent and common on this title. A clean copy justifies a significant premium.

**What to look for:** "Porky"/"Pecko Duck" in dead wax. Early matrix suffix letters. Visually inspect the opening groove of Stairway.

**Price range:** £80-300. Pay the premium for genuinely clean copies.

---

### Led Zeppelin — Houses of the Holy
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50014 (UK, 1973)
**Label:** Atlantic

**Note on cover:** The color printing on the gatefold was notoriously difficult to calibrate. Copies with vivid, well-registered color are worth more than washed-out examples. Ask for photos of the cover specifically.

**Price range:** £60-200.

---

### Led Zeppelin — Physical Graffiti
**Target:** Original UK Swan Song pressing
**Catalog:** Swan Song SSK 89400 (UK, 1975)
**Label:** Swan Song

Double album on the band's own label. Kashmir and In My Time of Dying reward a system capable of handling dynamic range. Original Swan Song pressing.

**Price range:** £60-200 for complete copies in good condition.

---

### Led Zeppelin — Presence
**Target:** Original UK Swan Song pressing
**Catalog:** Swan Song SSK 59402 (UK, 1976)
**Label:** Swan Song

Achilles Last Stand's layered guitars are among Page's most complex arrangements. The original pressing captures the separation between guitar parts more clearly than later transfers.

**Price range:** £40-150.

---

### Led Zeppelin — In Through the Out Door
**Target:** Original UK Swan Song pressing
**Catalog:** Swan Song SSK 59410 (UK, 1979)
**Label:** Swan Song

**Note on completeness:** Original copies came in a brown paper bag with six different inner sleeve variants. A complete set with all six inner sleeves is a collector's item. Ask about the paper bag and inner sleeve situation specifically.

**Price range:** £40-120. Premium for complete with paper bag.

---

### Led Zeppelin — 2014 Reissues (Jimmy Page supervised)
**Catalog:** Various Atlantic/Swan Song catalog numbers, 2014-2015

For any Zeppelin title where original condition is a concern, the 2014-2015 Page-supervised reissues cut from the original analog tapes are the legitimate modern alternative. Available individually or as a complete box. Avoid generic Atlantic back-catalog reissues from the 1980s-1990s.

---

## Pink Floyd

### Piper at the Gates of Dawn
**Target:** Original UK Columbia mono pressing
**Catalog:** Columbia SX 6157 mono / SCX 6157 stereo (UK, 1967)
**Label:** Columbia (black and silver, no EMI text)

The mono mix of this album — Syd Barrett's psychedelic masterpiece — is substantially different from the stereo and generally preferred. Interstellar Overdrive in mono is a wall of sound that the stereo spreads and somewhat dilutes. Recorded at Abbey Road simultaneously with Sgt. Pepper.

**What to look for:** Black and silver Columbia label WITHOUT EMI text (EMI text indicates later pressing). Original mono pressing.

**Price range:** £300-800 for good copies of the mono original. Stereo more accessible at £150-400.

---

### Meddle
**Target:** Original UK Harvest pressing
**Catalog:** Harvest SHVL 795 (UK, 1971)
**Label:** Harvest (harvest field design, no EMI text)

Echoes on side two — 23 minutes of gradually building psychedelic rock — is one of the great audiophile demonstration tracks when played on a capable system. The dynamic range from the opening piano note to the full band passages is extraordinary on the original pressing.

**What to look for:** Harvest label without EMI text. Early matrix suffixes. A and B suffix lacquer cuts.

**Price range:** £50-150 for good copies — excellent value.

---

### The Dark Side of the Moon
**Target:** Original UK Harvest pressing
**Catalog:** Harvest SHVL 804 (UK, 1973)
**Label:** Harvest
**Quad pressing:** Harvest Q4SHVL 804

The most documented pressing history in rock music. Has been pressed in more countries and more versions than almost any other album.

**First pressing identifiers:**
- Harvest label without EMI text
- Matrix in dead wax with "A" suffix and specific hand etching (no "EMI" text in dead wax)
- Original copies included one large poster of the band AND two pyramid prism stickers — complete copies with all inserts command significant premium

**The quad pressing** (Q4SHVL 804) was mixed specifically for four-channel playback by Roger Waters with different element positioning across the soundfield. For a quad-capable system this is a genuinely different and worthwhile experience.

**Reissue landscape:**
- Original Mobile Fidelity half-speed master (1982): excellent, still considered a top option
- Analogue Productions pressing: well regarded modern option
- Avoid generic pressings with "EMI" text in dead wax — these are from later, inferior lacquer cuts

**Price range:** Original UK first pressing complete with inserts: £200-600. Bare record: £80-200. Quad pressing: £100-200. Mobile Fidelity: £80-150 used.

---

### Wish You Were Here
**Target:** Original UK Harvest pressing
**Catalog:** Harvest SHVL 814 (UK, 1975)
**Label:** Harvest

**On completeness:** Original copies came in opaque black shrink wrap — the cover was not visible until opened. The wrap had a sticker of two businessmen shaking hands (one on fire) on the outside. Complete copies with the original black wrap intact are rare. The record inside included a postcard and a fabric patch.

Gilmour's guitar tone on the title track — acoustic twelve-string into electric — is one of the great recorded guitar sounds and the original pressing captures it with a naturalness that later pressings and digital versions somewhat harden.

**Price range:** £60-200. Premium for copies with original black wrap intact.

---

### Animals
**Target:** Original UK Harvest pressing
**Catalog:** Harvest SHVL 815 (UK, 1977)
**Label:** Harvest

Roger Waters at his most politically direct. Pigs Three Different Ones has synthesizer and guitar interplay that rewards good stereo separation.

**Price range:** £40-100.

---

### The Wall
**Target:** Original UK Harvest pressing
**Catalog:** Harvest SHDW 411 (UK, 1979)
**Label:** Harvest
**Quad mix:** exists and is worth seeking for quad-capable systems

Double album. The Wall quad mix places sound effects and musical elements across four channels to reinforce the album's conceptual themes of isolation.

**Condition warning:** Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 was a massive single and most copies were played heavily. Condition grade matters more than usual for this title.

**Price range:** £40-100 for good UK originals.

---

## Jimi Hendrix

### A note on the Hendrix catalog

Hendrix died in 1970. The subsequent decades saw extensive exploitation of the catalog through poorly assembled posthumous releases, unauthorized compilations, and overdubbed reissues assembled without the knowledge of original band members. The Experience Hendrix company — established after Al Hendrix won a legal battle in 1995 returning catalog control to the family — undertook a systematic reissue program with original engineer Eddie Kramer's involvement. Releases under the Experience Hendrix banner with Kramer's credit are considered legitimate. Anything on Ember, Hallmark, or Nutmeg labels is exploitative repackaging of pre-fame recordings and should be avoided.

**The UK versus US distinction:** The UK Track Records and US Reprise versions of all three studio albums have different track listings and in some cases different mixes. Both are valid artifacts but the UK versions reflect Hendrix's original intentions more closely for Are You Experienced.

---

### Are You Experienced
**Target:** Original UK Track Records mono pressing
**Catalog:** Track Records 612 001 mono / 613 001 stereo (UK, 1967)
**US version:** Reprise R 6261 mono / RS 6261 stereo

**Critical distinction:** The UK and US versions are fundamentally different albums. The UK version contains Red House, Remember, and Can You See Me in place of the hit singles Purple Haze, Hey Joe, and The Wind Cries Mary. The UK version reflects Hendrix's original artistic sequencing. The US version substituted commercially proven singles at Reprise's insistence.

The mono mix on the UK original is where the sonic argument is strongest. Recorded and mixed on four-track tape at Olympic Studios, London with engineer Eddie Kramer.

**What to look for:** Track Records label without Polydor distribution text (earliest pressings). Early matrix suffixes. UK mono (612 001) is the primary target.

**Price range:** UK mono original: £200-500. UK stereo original: £150-350. US Reprise mono: $100-300.

---

### Axis Bold as Love
**Target:** Original UK Track Records pressing
**Catalog:** Track Records 613 003 (UK, 1967)

**The lost master tape:** The completed side one master tape was left in a London taxi after a mixing session and never recovered. Side one on every pressing of this album is a remix made overnight from the four-track masters — Hendrix was never fully satisfied with it and felt it lacked depth compared to his original mix. This is baked into the artifact regardless of pressing quality.

The stereo field on this album is more deliberately exploited than Are You Experienced — Little Wing's guitar panning is compositional and the EXP opening is designed to disorient spatially.

**Price range:** UK Track original: £150-400. US Reprise (RS 6281): $100-250.

---

### Electric Ladyland
**Target:** Original US Reprise pressing
**Catalog:** Reprise 2RS 6307 (US, 1968)

**US pressing preferred over UK:** The UK Track Records cover featured nude women arranged around Hendrix's image — a decision made by Track Records against Hendrix's explicit objections. The US Reprise cover uses Hendrix's intended design. Sonically the US pressing is considered equivalent or slightly superior to the UK original.

Double album. The most ambitious Hendrix recording — sessions at Olympic in London, Record Plant in New York, and other studios. All Along the Watchtower and Voodoo Chile Slight Return are the centerpieces.

**What to look for:** Original Reprise pink and tan label with steamboat logo. RS 6307 catalog number on earliest pressings. Early matrix suffixes.

**Price range:** US Reprise original: $150-400. UK Track (613 008): £100-300.

---

### First Rays of the New Rising Sun
**Catalog:** MCA/Experience Hendrix (1997)

A legitimate posthumous release. Eddie Kramer and the Experience Hendrix team assembled recordings Hendrix left for what would have been his fourth studio album, guided by his documented intentions and session notes. Not a cash-grab compilation — a genuine archival effort. The recording quality is excellent and the pressing quality of the Experience Hendrix releases is generally good.

---

### BBC Sessions
**Catalog:** MCA/Experience Hendrix (1998)

Recordings made for BBC Radio between 1967 and 1969. Historically invaluable for capturing the Experience in a more spontaneous context. Several songs exist only in these BBC versions.

---

## The Rolling Stones

### A note on Decca versus London Records

UK pressings on Decca are the primary targets for the early albums. Decca was a technically meticulous label — their engineers were among the best in Britain — and the Stones benefited from this infrastructure. US London Records pressings are more commonly found but generally considered secondary.

---

### Aftermath
**Target:** Original UK Decca mono pressing
**Catalog:** Decca LK 4786 mono (UK, 1966)
**Label:** Decca (unboxed logo — earliest; boxed logo is later pressing)

The first album composed entirely by Jagger and Richards. The mono mix differs significantly from the stereo on several tracks. Paint It Black in mono has a more aggressive sitar placement in the mix. Mother's Little Helper has a different vocal balance.

**What to look for:** Unboxed Decca label (word Decca appears without a box around it — boxed label is a later pressing). Mono pressing (LK prefix, not SKL).

**Price range:** £100-300 for good mono originals.

---

### Beggars Banquet
**Target:** Original UK Decca pressing
**Catalog:** Decca SKL 4955 (UK, 1968)
**Label:** Decca

Recorded at Olympic Studios with Jimmy Miller producing — the same studio and producer who would work with Zeppelin. Sympathy for the Devil is one of the great recorded performances in rock.

**Note on the original cover:** The intended cover showed a graffiti-covered toilet. Decca refused to release it. Original copies came in a plain white sleeve. Subsequent pressings have the proper cover art. Original plain white sleeve copies are more collectible.

**Price range:** £80-250. Original plain white sleeve commands premium.

---

### Let It Bleed
**Target:** Original UK Decca pressing
**Catalog:** Decca SKL 5025 (UK, 1969)
**Label:** Decca

Gimme Shelter opens with Merry Clayton's vocal — one of the great recorded rock performances and a genuine test of a system's ability to handle sudden dynamic peaks without distortion.

**Price range:** £80-200.

---

### Sticky Fingers
**Target:** Original UK Rolling Stones Records pressing
**Catalog:** Rolling Stones Records COC 59100 (UK, 1971)
**Label:** Rolling Stones Records (distributed Atlantic)

**On the cover:** Original copies have a genuine metal zip on the denim cover. Later reissues have a plastic or decorative zip. Always verify the zip is functional metal when buying.

One of the great rock recordings — Wild Horses, Brown Sugar, Sister Morphine recorded at Muscle Shoals and Olympic with Jimmy Miller.

**Price range:** £80-200 for originals with working metal zip.

---

### Exile on Main St.
**Target:** Original UK Rolling Stones Records pressing
**Catalog:** Rolling Stones Records COC 69100 (UK, 1972)
**Label:** Rolling Stones Records

Recorded in the basement of Keith Richards' villa in the south of France on a mobile recording truck. The deliberately murky, lo-fi character is an aesthetic choice not a recording deficiency. Original pressing with postcards and booklet intact.

**Price range:** £80-200. Premium for complete with all inserts.

---

## Heavy Metal Origins

### Black Sabbath — Black Sabbath
**Target:** Original UK Vertigo pressing
**Catalog:** Vertigo VO 6 (UK, 1970)
**Label:** Vertigo (swirl label)

The swirl label — a distinctive hypnotic spiral design — is one of the most recognizable in collecting. Original swirl label pressings are premium items. The opening rain, church bell, and tritone riff of the title track is one of the great dramatic album openings in rock history. The Rodger Bain recording has genuine dynamic range that rewards a capable system.

**What to look for:** Vertigo swirl label (the hypnotic spiral design). Not the later plain Vertigo label. Early matrix suffixes.

**Price range:** £200-500 for good swirl label copies.

---

### Black Sabbath — Paranoid
**Target:** Original UK Vertigo pressing
**Catalog:** Vertigo 6360 011 (UK, 1970)
**Label:** Vertigo (swirl label — being phased out, some copies have plain label)

Recorded and released in the same year as the debut. War Pigs, Iron Man, Paranoid, Fairies Wear Boots — the complete statement of what Sabbath was.

**Condition warning:** Hugely popular and many copies were played heavily. Prioritize condition over finding a swirl label copy.

**Price range:** £100-400 for swirl label. £60-150 for plain Vertigo label originals in good condition.

---

### Black Sabbath — Master of Reality
**Target:** Original UK Vertigo pressing
**Catalog:** Vertigo 6360 050 (UK, 1971)
**Label:** Vertigo

Guitars tuned to C# — the lowest tuning of any Sabbath album — gives this the most massive low-end character in the catalog. A genuine test of a system's bass reproduction.

**Price range:** £80-200.

---

### Black Sabbath — Heaven and Hell
**Target:** Original UK Vertigo pressing
**Catalog:** Vertigo 9102 752 (UK, 1980)
**Label:** Vertigo

Ronnie James Dio's debut with Sabbath. A different character from the Ozzy albums but Dio's voice is one of the great heavy rock voices and the recording quality is excellent.

**Price range:** £40-100.

---

## Ozzy Osbourne

### A critical warning on the 2002 reissues

In the early 2000s Sharon Osbourne had the original bass and drum performances by Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake digitally replaced with new recordings by Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin on the reissues of Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. This was done in response to a royalties dispute and without disclosure. The 2002 and subsequent reissues are fundamentally different recordings from the originals. Daisley's melodic bass playing — particularly on Crazy Train — is a defining element of those albums and its absence is audible.

**Always verify:** Check liner notes for musician credits. If you see Trujillo and Bordin credited you have the doctored version. The 2011 30th anniversary reissues reportedly restored the original performances — verify with Discogs community notes for the specific pressing you're considering.

---

### Ozzy Osbourne — Blizzard of Ozz
**Target:** Original UK Jet Records pressing
**Catalog:** Jet Records JETLP 234 (UK, 1980)
**Label:** Jet Records (distributed CBS)

The debut solo album featuring Randy Rhoads' extraordinary guitar playing — a combination of classical training and metal aggression that was genuinely new. Mr. Crowley and Crazy Train with Daisley's original bass parts are the recordings to hear.

**Price range:** £40-100 for good original copies — excellent value given the situation.

---

### Ozzy Osbourne — Diary of a Madman
**Target:** Original UK Jet Records pressing
**Catalog:** Jet Records JETLP 237 (UK, 1981)
**Label:** Jet Records

Randy Rhoads' final studio recording. Flying High Again and Over the Mountain with Daisley's original bass parts. Same warning about 2002 reissues applies.

**Price range:** £40-100.

---

### Ozzy Osbourne — Tribute
**Catalog:** CBS 25priestLEY 1 (UK, 1987)

Live recordings from 1981 featuring Randy Rhoads. The only way to hear Rhoads in a concert context. Good recording quality for a live album of the era. Original pressing reasonably priced.

**Price range:** £20-60.

---

## AC/DC

### A note on Australian originals versus international releases

The early AC/DC albums recorded for Albert Productions in Australia with producers Harry Vanda and George Young (Angus and Malcolm's older brother) have a rawness and room character that the later Atlantic international pressings clean up. The Australian Albert Records pressings are the originals for the pre-Highway to Hell albums and contain different track listings from the international releases.

### T.N.T.
**Target:** Original Australian Albert Productions pressing
**Catalog:** Albert APLP 016 (Australia, 1975)
**Label:** Albert Productions

Released only in Australia. Contains the original versions of It's a Long Way to the Top If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll (with Bon Scott's bagpipes) and other tracks that were distributed internationally in altered form. The definitive document of where the band started.

**Price range:** $100-300 for good Australian copies. Source from Australian sellers on Discogs.

### Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
**Target:** Original Australian Albert Productions pressing
**Catalog:** Albert APLP 019 (Australia, 1976)
**Label:** Albert Productions

Again a different album from the international version. The Australian original is the primary artistic statement.

**Price range:** $80-200 for Australian originals.

---

### Let There Be Rock
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50366 (UK, 1977)
**Label:** Atlantic

The title track — eight minutes of escalating hard rock recorded live in the studio — is one of the great hard rock recordings. Guitar tone and drum impact on the original pressing are exceptional.

**Price range:** £30-60 for good copies — remarkable value.

---

### Powerage
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50483 (UK, 1978)
**Label:** Atlantic

Consistently underrated and underpriced relative to its quality. Sin City and Riff Raff are among the best Bon Scott era tracks.

**Price range:** £25-50 — exceptional value.

---

### If You Want Blood You've Got It
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50532 (UK, 1978)
**Label:** Atlantic

Live album recorded in Glasgow. The definitive document of the Bon Scott era band in concert. Recording quality is exceptional for a live rock album of this era. Consistently underpriced.

**Price range:** £20-40 — some of the best value in the catalog.

---

### Highway to Hell
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50628 (UK, 1979)
**Label:** Atlantic

Mutt Lange's first production for the band. Bon Scott's voice is captured with more clarity than any previous recording. The last album before Scott's death in February 1980.

**Price range:** £40-100 for good UK originals.

---

### Back in Black
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50735 (UK, 1980)
**Label:** Atlantic

Recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, following Bon Scott's death. Produced by Mutt Lange. Brian Johnson's debut.

**UK versus US:** The UK pressing has a slightly lower cutting level than the US, preserving more dynamic headroom. Hells Bells — which opens with a genuine 600-pound bronze bell cast specifically for the recording — has a longer, more natural decay on the UK pressing. The kick drum on Phil Rudd's kit has more definition and less compression.

**Price range:** £40-80 for good UK originals — very reasonable.

---

### For Those About to Rock
**Target:** Original UK Atlantic pressing
**Catalog:** Atlantic K50851 (UK, 1981)
**Label:** Atlantic

The cannon fire at the end of the title track is a test of a system's bass reproduction. Original pressing.

**Price range:** £30-70.

---

## Metallica

### The Black Album (Metallica)
**Target:** Original 1991 Elektra pressing OR 2021 Abbey Road half-speed master
**Catalog:** Elektra 61113-1 (US, 1991)
**Half-speed master catalog:** 0602435795300 (2021)

Produced by Bob Rock at One on One Recording, Los Angeles. The original 1991 pressing has a dynamic range (DR) of approximately 10-11. The 2012 remaster is one of the most widely cited examples of loudness war destruction with a DR of approximately 5-6 — the dynamic structure of Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, and The Unforgiven is severely compromised.

**The 2012 remaster:** Avoid for any purpose other than curiosity. The quiet-to-loud dynamics that define the album's best tracks are crushed to near-uniform loudness.

**The 2021 half-speed master:** Cut by Miles Showell at Abbey Road from the original analog tapes. Restores dynamic range close to the original 1991 levels. The recommended modern pressing.

**What to look for on originals:** Original Elektra black label with the 61113-1 catalog number. Matrix numbers indicating original 1991 production. Condition is important — hugely popular and many copies were played heavily.

**Price range:** Original 1991 pressing: $50-120 for good copies. 2021 half-speed master: $40-60 new.

## Nirvana

### Bleach
**Target:** Original Sub Pop pressing
**Catalog:** Sub Pop SP34 (US, 1989)
**Label:** Sub Pop (green label)

Recorded in three days for $606 at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle. Jack Endino engineered. The rawness is the point — this is the Melvins-influenced sludge metal foundation before the commercial polish of Nevermind.

**Price range:** $100-300 for good copies of the original. Sub Pop 30th anniversary reissue (2019) is a legitimate modern option.

---

### Nevermind
**Target:** Original 1991 DGC pressing OR 2011 20th anniversary reissue
**Catalog:** DGC DGCLP 24425 (UK) / DGC-24425 (US, 1991)
**20th anniversary reissue:** 2011, supervised by Novoselic and Grohl
**Half-speed master:** 2021, cut by Miles Showell at Abbey Road

Produced by Butch Vig. The original 1991 pressing has significantly more dynamic range than subsequent reissues. Smells Like Teen Spirit's quiet verse to loud chorus dynamic is substantially compressed on later pressings.

**UK versus US:** The UK DGC pressing is generally considered slightly preferable — lower cutting level, more dynamic headroom.

**Note on original pressing prices:** Original 1991 pressings in genuinely good condition have reached $500-1000+ in the current market. The 2011 20th anniversary reissue supervised by the surviving band members from the original analog tapes is the recommended accessible alternative.

**Price range:** Original 1991 UK: £300-800. 2011 anniversary reissue: $50-100. 2021 half-speed master: $40-60 new.

---

### In Utero
**Target:** Original 1993 DGC pressing
**Catalog:** DGC DGC-24607 (US, 1993)

Recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota in two weeks. Albini's minimal-processing philosophy produces the most sonically honest Nirvana recording — Cobain's voice is close-miked and unprocessed in a way the produced Nevermind doesn't expose.

**Note on the mix:** DGC had Scott Litt remix Heart-Shaped Box and All Apologies for radio play. The album as commercially released contains Litt's mixes for those two tracks. Albini's original mixes are sonically rawer and more consistent with the album's overall character — they circulate in various forms.

**Price range:** $40-80 for good original copies. The 2013 20th anniversary reissue is considered good.

---

### MTV Unplugged in New York
**Target:** Original DGC pressing
**Catalog:** DGC (1994)

Recorded November 1993 at Sony Music Studios, New York. Released after Cobain's death in April 1994. The acoustic arrangements and Cobain's unguarded vocal performances — particularly on the Lead Belly cover Where Did You Sleep Last Night — make this one of the most emotionally significant recordings in rock history.

**Price range:** $50-150 for good original copies. Well worth owning.

## Recommended Modern Reissue Sources

When original pressings are unavailable, condition-compromised, or prohibitively expensive, these sources are generally trustworthy:

**Analogue Productions / Acoustic Sounds** — consistently excellent pressing quality, direct-from-tape where claimed. Their UHQR line is the premium tier.

**Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL)** — historically excellent half-speed masters. Note: a 2022 controversy revealed they used a digital intermediate step in their mastering chain while marketing releases as purely analog. The records still often sound excellent but the "pure analog" claim is complicated.

**Quality Record Pressings (QRP)** — the pressing plant used by Analogue Productions. Considered the finest pressing facility currently operating in the US.

**Abbey Road half-speed masters** — Miles Showell's work at Abbey Road is consistently excellent. The Metallica and Nirvana half-speed masters are recommended examples.

**Jimmy Page supervised Zeppelin reissues (2014-2015)** — legitimate and well executed.

**Experience Hendrix reissues with Eddie Kramer credit** — legitimate and worth owning.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**Dead wax / Runout groove:** The area between the last track and the label. Contains matrix numbers, pressing plant codes, and sometimes hand-etched inscriptions by mastering engineers.

**Matrix number:** Alphanumeric code etched in the dead wax identifying the lacquer cut. Lower suffix letters (A, B, C) generally indicate earlier lacquer cuts closer to the original session.

**Deep groove:** A concentric pressed ring around the label area on certain early pressings (particularly Blue Note). Generally indicates an earlier pressing.

**RVG stamp:** Rudy Van Gelder's personal mark etched in the dead wax of Blue Note and other recordings he engineered. Hand-etched on originals, mechanically stamped on reissues.

**Half-speed mastering:** Both the lacquer lathe and source tape run at half speed simultaneously, allowing the cutting stylus to respond to lower frequencies than at normal speed. Improves high-frequency accuracy and transient reproduction on playback.

**DR (Dynamic Range):** The ratio between the quietest and loudest passages in a recording. Higher DR means more dynamic contrast. Modern loudness war mastering often produces DR values of 5-8; well-preserved original pressings typically measure 10-14 or higher.

**Loudness war:** The practice of mastering recordings at higher average levels by compressing and limiting dynamic range. Makes recordings sound louder on the radio but destroys dynamic contrast on home systems.

**Porky / Pecko Duck:** Dead wax inscriptions by UK mastering engineer George Peckham, cut on side one (Porky) and side two (Pecko Duck). Considered an indicator of quality cutting on many UK rock pressings from the 1970s.
