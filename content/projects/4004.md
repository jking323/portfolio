The Intel 4004 was the world's first commercially available microprocessor, designed by Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stanley Mazor in 1971. I'm recreating it from original documentation using modern fabrication techniques while preserving the original architecture.

The goal isn't to improve the 4004 — it's to understand it completely by building it. Every gate, every timing relationship, every design decision.

## Current Status

PCBWay has sponsored the fabrication. I am currently writing the verilog slowly to faithfully match the indiosyncrocies(spelling?) of the PMOS process. This is a difficult nut to crack because I initially wanted to faithfully replicate transistor for transistor but unfortunately that is not possible in any modern process and even if it was I wouldn't be able to match hand cut rubylith. So new plan! Faithful funcitons but we will have to abandon the internal hold and setup requirements of the 4004. That's ok though, from the mcs4 perspective as long as the data is on the bus when it looks for it we are golden! The core will still run at it's original 740Khz though the gb180 or sky130 process allows for significantly faster speeds that is what the pipelined and risc-4 variants are for!

## Research

Unfortunately the university wasn't able to squeeze me in before I fly back home. That's ok thankfully the 4004 is incredibly well documented given it's significance in computing history so we are good to continue researching online. If you come across anything that you want to add please let me know!

I'm planning a visit to Politecnico di Milano to research Faggin's early work at SGS-Fairchild before he moved to Intel. The silicon gate technology he developed there is what made the 4004 possible
