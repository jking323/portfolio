The Intel 4004 was the world's first commercially available microprocessor, designed by Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, and Stanley Mazor in 1971. I'm recreating it from original documentation using modern fabrication techniques while preserving the original architecture.

The goal isn't to improve the 4004 — it's to understand it completely by building it. Every gate, every timing relationship, every design decision.

## Current Status

PCBWay has sponsored the fabrication. Schematics are drawn from the original die photographs and Faggin's notes. Layout is in progress.

## Research

I'm planning a visit to Politecnico di Milano to research Faggin's early work at SGS-Fairchild before he moved to Intel. The silicon gate technology he developed there is what made the 4004 possible.
