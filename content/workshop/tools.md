A running list of the tools I reach for most often, both physical and digital.

## Physical

- Nikon Z7II — photography
- Weller soldering station
- Rigol oscilloscope
- Brother P-touch label maker — everything gets a label

## Digital

- Librewolf — hardened Firefox
- Alfred — launcher and sovereign stack gateway
- Kagi — paid search, no tracking
- Proton suite — mail, VPN, drive, passwords
- Hugo — this site
- KiCad — PCB design
- Docker — everything runs in containers

## Services I Pay For

- Backblaze ($9/mo) — unlimited backup
- Kagi ($10/mo) — search
- Proton Unlimited — email and VPN
- Tailscale — mesh VPN (free tier)
- Cloudflare Pages — hosting this site (free tier)

I don't pay for streaming music, cloud storage, or productivity software anymore.
