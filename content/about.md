I'm Jeremy King. I live in central Florida, where I work as an electrical engineer designing industrial computers and co-own a cigar shop. I'm moving to Rome.

I build things: hardware, infrastructure, businesses. My current projects include recreating the Intel 4004 microprocessor, designing an open-source baseboard management controller, and running a self-hosted server stack that handles everything from music to document management.

I believe in the small web. This site has no JavaScript, no tracking, no analytics, no cookies, and no ads. It loads in under 50KB. It's built with Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## This Site

The design is intentionally minimal. Georgia on cream with burnt orange links and dotted underlines. The CSS is inline and under 3KB. There is no JavaScript.

The content is organized as a digital garden — some pages are finished, some are growing, some are just planted. The status tags tell you where things stand. Nothing here is permanent; I revise and expand as I learn.

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Source on [Gitea](https://gitea.lab) (private) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jking323) (public).
